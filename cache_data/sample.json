The performance is impressive, with a powerful engine that handles both city driving and off-road adventures seamlessly. The interior is spacious and comfortable, equipped with modern technology and user-friendly features. I particularly love the advanced safety features that give me peace of mind on the road.\n\nFuel efficiency is also a pleasant surprise, making it a great option for everyday use. Plus, the value for money is outstanding compared to other brands. Overall, I highly recommend the LDV T60 in any class to anyone in the market for a reliable and versatile ute. Great job, LDV!\n\nAnd a huge shoutout to the sales team and Saad for such a caring and homelike feel and making sure i made the right decision. Make sure you visit the dealership !",

When my blue G10 was not ready, he was kind enough to loan me another G10 until my vehicle arrived. Due to issues with customs, my vehicle was sent back to Asia causing unforeseen delays. Being adamant about the blue, Michael rang other dealers around the country and ended up sourcing my blue G10 from Western Australia. By the time we received our G10, we'd already had the loan vehicle for several weeks at no cost. Michael constantly kept me up to date with phone calls, emails and SMS's.

            "Description": "That's really frustrating! I bought the LDV D90 last year because it had great features and was spacious. But before my first service, a part on the back side came out. During the first service, I mentioned the issue to the service provider, and they said they would organize the car part for me. I was expecting a call, but they never got back to me. After a few months, I called and asked about the part, and they said they had received it. Such bad service!\n\nYesterday, when I booked my car to get the part fixed, they told me I had to keep my car there for the whole day. They had initially said it would only take an hour. I couldn't stay the whole day because I had no other way to get home. At the service center, a person named Kris said they would call and book my car for the part fix. But yesterday passed, and I haven't received any call or message from the service center.\n\nI don't think I should recommend LDV to anyone else. If the service center treats existing customers like this, I wonder how they would serve new customers. It's disappointing.",

Once they received the cash they could not wait to get me out the door. I asked numerous times for the transfer rego slip  that you  normally get and I was brushed off numerous times. I eventually got a fine from the motor registry for not doing this. The sales rep then blamed even though I attempted to try and rectify this early on. Their after care is very poor and they only look for the sale and push you out once they have their funds. I would give zero stars if I could as it was really poor service after 30 years of buying cars from other places. I would avoid this place, unless you are willing to take the risk of poor after market assistance.",
