We had our Car broke down at blacktown and towed it away to this car service centre which i highly recommend to everyone for own peace and best interest  to steer away ( as many other poor reviews also highlighted  I wish I would know before so I would  avoid this nightmare and would  bring somewhere else . Anyway a technician from roadside assistance that helped us to remove the car from the driveway , detecting that was an issue related with ECU as the computer system was failing the connect hence was flashing all the lights ( a things that was already starting a while ago but the car was still functioning as well a  the technician from previous  car service that serviced the car literally 2 months before was mentioning that system need to be reviewed from MG authorized dealer ) but those so called experts from this car shop insisted that was the battery with low voltage which  for a car brand new with only 2 years and 8 months would be quite unreasonable and unjustifiable so  they  asked me to pay over $300 to get fixed as warranty was not covered ( although initially one of their mechanic was also saying shouldn‚Äôt be the battery as the car is brand new and only 19000 kms ). As I couldn‚Äôt afford to stay without car and have a little kid to drop at school I was kindly ask a car replacement for the time of fixing and I was rejected . Then with no option left I asked to get fixed and to pay but to review the entire car and the ECU system which I was reassured that was fine . As I wouldn‚Äôt trust them due the lack of communication and professionalism from the day I visited this shop and literally from everyone .. the issue was around the corner .. we have picked up the car , my partner with kid drove away and after an hour the car start to flash all the lights again and the steer wheel getting hard and break pad stiff ( could be also very dangerous) . It happened exactly what I was worried . Then email , email and again email back and forth with phone call and no reply was sent . Spoke to the receptionist that informed me that manager in 10 mins will contact you..  . Still waiting and Not sure how many 10 minutes have passed ever since .

First they don't order all the parts and charge you for the loan car, they will ask you to come to collect the car by saying it is ready for pick up once you go there they say they ordered the parts and it will take few weeks then I will have to come and pay for the loan car again which is ridiculous I just did't pay for the loan car fuel and fee for them to diagnose when I already told them what the issue was with the parts which was visible as well. I notified there frustrated salesperson Nicholas that not all the parts are ordered and he told me that he will take pictures and order it later just to get rid of me. After that I called them twice on 2 different days and they said they did not order the part and someone will get back to me. This whole experience has been frustrating. Very poor communication internally.\n\nUpdate 04.04.2024:\nI posted my review almost 2 months ago, today is 04.04.2024. I spoke to their manager Danny during these 2 months,  he pretended that he cared and promised that he will give me a call back by the end of day which was 2 weeks ago, I believe his days are longer than mine, still waiting for the phone call. I wish I had another MG service center nearby so I never had to go back to this terrible service center again.\n\nUpdate 21.05.2024:\nI called them again almost 2 weeks ago and I was advised that the part arrived in March but nobody gave me a call and then they did exactly what they do, started blaming different departments. I asked to speak to the manager but I was told asked to send an email and I am still waiting for a response.\n\nUpdate 10.06.2024:\nI still have not received any response, I have also emailed MG in which I cc'd the customer care, manager 'Deni' and 'Nina' and advised them about the complaint that I have made to fair trade Nsw but MG still have not responded.\n\nUpdate 14.06.2024:\nI was contacted by fair trade, I explained them about the whole scenario, after fair trade contacted them I received a phone call on the same day from their manager Deni, I believe they don't take you seriously unless you get fair trade involved. I booked my car for 27.06.2024 thinking that both the issues will be fixed (how silly of me), I received a call from them saying it is ready for pick up, once I picked it up I noticed that they only fixed one issue, Muhammed was the representative I was dealing with. He said that it will take 15-20 mins to get it sorted but I had to go back to work. I was told when I will come back for my first service they will fix it and provide a loan car.\n\nUpdate 27.09.2024:\nI booked my car for service and loan car was not available so I was like as long as my car gets fixed I will ignore the fact that I am not getting a loan car, but as always they have the worst work ethics and customer service. I dropped my car at 8:15am and I did not receive a call regarding my car if it is ready or not. I had to call at 3pm and I was advised that I will receive a call from Muhammad who was busy. I was worried that I might not have my car for the weekend as till 4:15pm I did not receive a call, I had to call and the person at customer service said that my car was ready and they are short staffed which is why they could not call, I only had 45mins to reach the service centre. I went to the service centre and guess what the issue was still not resolved, this time he said the part they ordered was broken and for my carplay issue he advised to buy an apple data transfer cable. Now I will need to go back for the fourth time to fix a minor issue. I still don't know how they are running this business or if nobody cares about this service centre.\n\nI keep on updating my review so nobody else has to go through what I am going through.

You can see i don't drive that much & that's because it spends more time in the workshop than on the road!?\n\nI have been taking my 2017 LDV G10 sparky van to LDV Parramatta Service Centre since new.  Actually since LDV Five Dock Service Centre closed up after my first service.  I found both service centres were professional & the staff there treat customers well.\n\nJamie, the service manager & Jodi, the service advisor are both excellent at their customer service.\n\nI felt that Jodi was doing her best that she could but just overwhelmed by all the LDV product's continuous issues coming from customers.\n\nIn fact, from my experience, all the staffs that i have dealt with at all the LDVs had been satisfactory.\n\nHowever, what is unsatisfactory is the quality of the LDV product itself.  Namely, my G10 sparky van.\n\nI don't want to write an essay on it here but let's just said it has more issues within its three years of manufacturers warranty, than all the other cars that i have owned, combined!\n\nI definitely got to see a lot of Jamie, that's for sure!\n\nI used to have a 2011 Hyundai iLoad sparky van & that was the opposite of my current G10.  I had my G10 sparky van since new, it had been back for warranty issues & repairs more times than i can count with my fingers!\n\nBTW, also, my G10 sparky started to rust too!  So much for quality!  I had to today spend $260 to get \"The Touch-Up Guys\" Adam, to fix up the rust repair & respray because of the poor design & quality of this LDV product.\n\nI have no confidence in this LDV product (my G10).\n\nAs a matter of fact, i still have more issues with my current G10 that they told me were recified, when it was still under its three years manufacturer's warranty!\n\nSo to sum it up.  Customer service at LDVs are satisfactory.  The people working there are working on a uphill battle to serve the customers the best they could with a inferior LDV product.\n\nSo, four stars to the LDV customer service.\n\nAnd one star for the actual LDV product itself.  \"Cheap & nasty\"!\n\nFour stars plus one star equals five stars!  So if LDV would improve the quality of their product, then they would become five stars, if they kept their pricing competitive, that is!\n\nBecause of LDV, i almost had a divorce with my wife of 20 years plus because of her nagging me every single day about my poor purchase on this poor LDV product (my current G10 sparky van).\n\nAnd also there is no capped priced servicing plan for it, so you know what!?\n\nBTW, my wife drives a Toyota!  Oh what a feeling, Toyota!\n\nOh, i don't get that feeling with LDV!  In fact, it is the opposite!\n\nCome on LDV!  Pull your socks up!  A sparky like me gave you guys a break (try), please as least give it your best shot!\n\nBTW, because of this sour experience with LDV, i am never going to buy another LDV ever again & i have been telling everybody who wants to know what i think of my 2017 LDV G10, that it is not worth the pain & the stress & the headache & your marriage over a van!\n\nGame over LDV!?\n\nI feel sorry for all the people that works in LDV.  Especially in LDV Parramatta Service Centre.  To come to work everyday to hear more customer complaints on their LDVs, every single work day.\n\nSo, i have made it my mission to whenever someone asked me about my 2017 LDV G10, i will give them a thumbs down!\n\nP.s. My reverse camera works when it feels like it!?  And the funny thing is, the senior service technician came to me in person & told me he personally fixed it, when it was within its manufacturer warranty, means there is more to the poor LDV product than the technician himself.\n\nP.s.s.

I am writing to express my utmost dissatisfaction with my recent experience purchasing an LDV Bus from your dealership and the subsequent handling of issues that arose shortly after the purchase.\n\nOn 23/06/2023, I purchased a brand new LDV Bus from your dealership. To my dismay, within one week of the purchase, the vehicle experienced a severe breakdown, rendering it inoperable. I immediately contacted your workshop and notified them of the issue, hoping for a swift resolution. However, the experience that followed has been nothing short of a nightmare.\n\nThe vehicle was taken to your workshop for repairs, but instead of resolving the issue, it appears that the vehicle suffered additional damage during the repair process. This is completely unacceptable and has caused significant inconvenience and financial burden to me. I expected a brand new vehicle to be reliable, and the current situation has shattered my confidence in the product and your after-sales service.\n\nTo make matters worse, your workshop seems unwilling to take responsibility for the damages caused and has suggested that I should take the vehicle back without it being adequately fixed. This is simply unacceptable, as I refuse to accept a faulty vehicle that can potentially cause more harm down the road. Moreover, I was informed that I would be charged for not taking the vehicle back, which is not only unfair but adds insult to injury.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, the communication and response from your workshop and dealership have been extremely slow, leaving me in the dark about the status of my vehicle and the progress of the resolution process. This lack of responsiveness and accountability has only added to my frustration and disappointment.\n\nI expect immediate action to be taken to rectify the situation. I demand that my LDV Bus be thoroughly inspected, repaired to an excellent working condition, and compensated for any additional damages caused during the repair process. Furthermore, I request a written assurance that such issues will not arise in the future and a clear explanation of how you plan to prevent such incidents.\n\nI trust that you understand the gravity of this situation and will take the necessary steps to address my concerns promptly. I urge you to treat this matter with the utmost urgency to avoid further escalation.\n\nIf my concerns are not adequately addressed within a reasonable timeframe, I may have no choice but to seek legal assistance and share my negative experience with others, including on social media platforms and relevant consumer review websites.", "Images": null, "When": ""}, {"Name": "Jamie Rogers", "ProfilePicture": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKt3y4EIpMDjfV9SEx337Neb55ie9Uebx7Wtcq3hxANa5kw-g=s120-c-rp-mo-br100", "Rating": 5, "Description": "Great people, friendly, made the whole process easy, I have bought a new car from Toyota in the past and the team at LDV Kingswood left them in the dust.

Everything looked amazing at face value and it was a huge upgrade from the car I had at the time. Despite my strong distrust for car dealerships, I had a good feeling and decided to take the leap. The dealer wouldn't allow my brother (a mechanic) to scan the car for any potential problems until a deposit was made. He also promised 3 months warranty if any problems did arise after purchase. With warranty as a safety net, I bought the car and was in love- until oil started leaking from the rocket gasket and the SRS light appeared on my dash.\n\n\"No problem\", I thought. It has warranty. I took the car in and the men were more than happy to help. I drove away and mere days later, the car was leaking oil again and the SRS light had returned. So, I emailed the dealership and was met with a pathetic \"your car is older than 10 years old, so the warranty is void. We repaired your car out of good will.\" Of course, after threatening to involve fair trading, LDV invited me to bring my car in for ANOTHER inspection and repair. This time they actually did their job- or so I thought.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my car was leaking puddles of oil. I rang my mechanic brother who urged me to go to the nearest mechanic I could find. The mechanic was astounded by what he saw. He regrettably informed me that whoever had done my last major service (of course, it was LDV) had screwed the cap too tightly on the oil filter, to the point where it had pierced the filter and it had now cracked, leaking large quantities of oil everywhere. If I had driven for 10 more minutes, he said my engine would have ran out of oil and imploded. Along with this, my rocket gasket cover had never been replaced, as LDV had ensured me. Instead, it had been temporarily sealed with silicone. How convenient that it was a temporary fix that would last just long enough that the promised 3 month warranty  would be voided by the time it became a problem. And, of course, bad things come in threes. That same day, I found out that LDV had never supplied me with a wheel lock key. The mechanic found this out as he was unable to remove my wheel to access my rocket gasket cover without it. I can't even say I was surprised with anything this mechanic was telling me.\n\nCar dealerships have a horrible reputation for a reason. I will personally never trust any dealership again and I was stupid enough to do so in the first place. LDV sold a car that was a huge safety risk and tried to trick me out of repairing it by blaming the age of the car rather than their incompetence.

After a few months, I called and asked about the part, and they said they had received it. Such bad service!\n\nYesterday, when I booked my car to get the part fixed, they told me I had to keep my car there for the whole day. They had initially said it would only take an hour. I couldn't stay the whole day because I had no other way to get home. At the service center, a person named Kris said they would call and book my car for the part fix.

When my son asked to try the car in sports mode, he hesitated before eventually putting it on, but only allowed my son to drive about 500 metres plus around 200m on sports mode before switching it back. That hardly gives a serious buyer any chance to properly experience the car.\n\nWhen we sat down afterwards to discuss pricing, I asked for some extras to be included ‚Äî slide shutters for the canopy, tinted windows, a tow bar, and weather shields. I also asked about servicing, but the assistant manager couldn‚Äôt explain it properly, which was both surprising and unprofessional.\n\nFinally, I said my budget was $45,500. His response was simply that he couldn‚Äôt do it and ‚Äúgood luck with it‚Äù ‚Äî no thank you, no courtesy, nothing. That was the final straw.\n\nOn the way home, my son looked at me and said he no longer wanted to buy an LDV at all because of the lack of attention we received at Parramatta LDV. This was especially heartbreaking because in just two days it will be his 22nd birthday, and all he wanted was to purchase his new ‚Äútoy‚Äù ‚Äî something he had been so excited about, especially since some of his friends already own one. Instead of being a happy milestone, it turned into a huge disappointment.\n\nWe‚Äôre in 2025, and sadly, discrimination still happens ‚Äî whether it was because my son was considered too young or perhaps because of my skin colour, we were clearly not given the same respect and attention as other customers. That is unacceptable.\n\nIf I knew I was going to be treated like that, I would have just bought a car from Marketplace. At least there, I wouldn‚Äôt have expected any customer service.

I bought LDV T60 from this dealer. At first, the sales told me I can pick up the Ute with the canopy and roof racks and ladder rack in one week. That's around 15th of June. Then 3 days later I was told should be 2 weeks. Then 3rd of July. Then 13th of July. And till end of July I was still waiting for the ladder rack. At the beginning of August, I said I don't want to wait as the sales told me they couldn't find a ladder shop to install ladder tack in Sydney. I asked them to deduct $3000 and picked up my Ute at 7th of August. When I picked up my ute. I found the Ute was already registered from 25th of June which the dealer didn't inform me. Also I asked the floor mats but they only gave me the front ones. I asked central locks for canopy but only rear door is central locked. The side windows are not. What is even worse is the tyre pressure is only 20 PSI when I picked up the Ute. Never buy any car from this dealership.

To put it simply DO NOT buy a new from this dealership. The after sales is absolutely horrible to deal with. We purchased a brand new LDV D90 for $51,000. After two weeks the vehicle had a fault which although after further investigation ( at my expense) appeared to be a reasonably minor issue and which should have been easy to fix and identify but now has turned into 2 month saga. Expect to wait up to 2 weeks to a month to get your vehicle seen to by a mechanic then that mechanic doesn‚Äôt identify the fault. Then pay your own mechanic to diagnose the issue which he finds easily and quickly. I then return back to the dealership with all the info of the issue only to be told ‚Äúwe need to do our own investigation‚Äù and you‚Äôre wasting your time. Funnily enough they did their ‚Äúown investigation ‚Äú before and found nothing wrong. Rude, snarky and generally difficult to deal with would sum up the after sales at the dealership. So do yourself a favour and save yourself stress and hassle because trust me their dealership treats it‚Äôs first time customers\nlike they are of no importance whatsoever. The dealer principal obviously has no interest in getting any repeat sales. We will buy our next new car in two years time somewhere else.

Paid upfront as Max said I couldn‚Äôt pay on the day otherwise we needed a bank cheque but we live 2hrs from a bank and being told Friday  wasn‚Äôt an option of getting one. On our way down Max rang and said he was off sick so see Greg when we asked for Greg he said he knew nothing about it and dismissed us very quickly to someone else who intern came out with a key and said paperwork would be ready soon.

The incident, which occurred in the middle of the road, not only caused significant inconvenience but also left me feeling embarrassed and humiliated in front of others.\n\nOn Friday 23/6/2023, I excitedly acquired the aforementioned vehicle from your dealership, anticipating a reliable and seamless driving experience. However, this perception was shattered when, on Friday 30/7/2023, the car suddenly malfunctioned, leaving me stranded and helpless on a busy street.\n\nThe unexpected breakdown attracted attention from fellow motorists and pedestrians, creating an uncomfortable situation that I could not escape. It was deeply embarrassing to have the car fail in such a conspicuous manner, causing disruption and inconvenience to not only myself but also others who were inconvenienced by the resulting traffic congestion.\n\nAs a customer who placed trust in your company's product, I expected the car to provide a reliable mode of transportation. Unfortunately, the breakdown has undermined that trust and has resulted in significant embarrassment and inconvenience for me. The incident has also raised concerns about the vehicle's quality and reliability.\n\nI implore you to take immediate action to rectify this matter. I request a thorough investigation into the root cause of the breakdown and a comprehensive repair of the vehicle at no additional cost to me. Additionally, I anticipate a reasonable compensation for the embarrassment, inconvenience, and any associated costs that this incident has caused.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that your company recognizes the gravity of this situation and takes swift and appropriate measures to address it. I trust that you value your customers and their satisfaction, and I expect a timely response outlining the steps your company will take to resolve this matter satisfactorily.\n\nThank you for your immediate attention to this matter.
