As I couldn‚Äôt afford to stay without car and have a little kid to drop at school I was kindly ask a car replacement for the time of fixing and I was rejected .

I wish I had another MG service center nearby so I never had to go back to this terrible service center again.\n\nUpdate 21.05.2024:\nI called them again almost 2 weeks ago and I was advised that the part arrived in March but nobody gave me a call and then they did exactly what they do, started blaming different departments. I asked to speak to the manager but I was told asked to send an email and I am still waiting for a response.\n\nUpdate 10.06.2024:\nI still have not received any response, I have also emailed MG in which I cc'd the customer care, manager 'Deni' and 'Nina' and advised them about the complaint that I have made to fair trade Nsw but MG still have not responded.\n\nUpdate 14.06.2024:\nI was contacted by fair trade, I explained them about the whole scenario, after fair trade contacted them I received a phone call on the same day from their manager Deni, I believe they don't take you seriously unless you get fair trade involved. I booked my car for 27.06.2024 thinking that both the issues will be fixed (how silly of me), I received a call from them saying it is ready for pick up, once I picked it up I noticed that they only fixed one issue, Muhammed was the representative I was dealing with. He said that it will take 15-20 mins to get it sorted but I had to go back to work. I was told when I will come back for my first service they will fix it and provide a loan car.\n\nUpdate 27.09.2024:\nI booked my car for service and loan car was not available so I was like as long as my car gets fixed I will ignore the fact that I am not getting a loan car, but as always they have the worst work ethics and customer service. I dropped my car at 8:15am and I did not receive a call regarding my car if it is ready or not. I had to call at 3pm and I was advised that I will receive a call from Muhammad who was busy. I was worried that I might not have my car for the weekend as till 4:15pm I did not receive a call, I had to call and the person at customer service said that my car was ready and they are short staffed which is why they could not call, I only had 45mins to reach the service centre. I went to the service centre and guess what the issue was still not resolved, this time he said the part they ordered was broken and for my carplay issue he advised to buy an apple data transfer cable. Now I will need to go back for the fourth time to fix a minor issue. I still don't know how they are running this business or if nobody cares about this service centre.\n\nI keep on updating my review so nobody else has to go through what I am going through. Their management is as inexperienced as their staff.","Images":null,"When":""},{"Name":"Ashton Lavaring","ProfilePicture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXo9Shl968fbGMxtbxB0xc2g-XadHNIx98PgIhgH7HmAnN0dkCa=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","Rating":4,"Description":"A little bit more attention to detail would have been nice.\n\nHad my car serviced here, it had been ready to pick for over 24 hours.\n\nWhen I picked it up the car wash that was included in the service hadn't been done.\n\nThe staff were helpful/ polite  and really quick at getting it pushed through to get washed but still had to wait another hour.\n\nNot the end of the world.

You can see i don't drive that much \u0026 that's because it spends more time in the workshop than on the road!?\n\nI have been taking my 2017 LDV G10 sparky van to LDV Parramatta Service Centre since new.  Actually since LDV Five Dock Service Centre closed up after my first service.  I found both service centres were professional \u0026 the staff there treat customers well.\n\nJamie, the service manager \u0026 Jodi, the service advisor are both excellent at their customer service.\n\nI felt that Jodi was doing her best that she could but just overwhelmed by all the LDV product's continuous issues coming from customers.\n\nIn fact, from my experience, all the staffs that i have dealt with at all the LDVs had been satisfactory.\n\nHowever, what is unsatisfactory is the quality of the LDV product itself.  Namely, my G10 sparky van.\n\nI don't want to write an essay on it here but let's just said it has more issues within its three years of manufacturers warranty, than all the other cars that i have owned, combined!\n\nI definitely got to see a lot of Jamie, that's for sure!\n\nI used to have a 2011 Hyundai iLoad sparky van \u0026 that was the opposite of my current G10.  I had my G10 sparky van since new, it had been back for warranty issues \u0026 repairs more times than i can count with my fingers!\n\nBTW, also, my G10 sparky started to rust too!  So much for quality!  I had to today spend $260 to get \"The Touch-Up Guys\" Adam, to fix up the rust repair \u0026 respray because of the poor design \u0026 quality of this LDV product.\n\nI have no confidence in this LDV product (my G10).\n\nAs a matter of fact, i still have more issues with my current G10 that they told me were recified, when it was still under its three years manufacturer's warranty!\n\nSo to sum it up.  Customer service at LDVs are satisfactory.  The people working there are working on a uphill battle to serve the customers the best they could with a inferior LDV product.\n\nSo, four stars to the LDV customer service.\n\nAnd one star for the actual LDV product itself.  \"Cheap \u0026 nasty\"!\n\nFour stars plus one star equals five stars!  So if LDV would improve the quality of their product, then they would become five stars, if they kept their pricing competitive, that is!\n\nBecause of LDV, i almost had a divorce with my wife of 20 years plus because of her nagging me every single day about my poor purchase on this poor LDV product (my current G10 sparky van).\n\nAnd also there is no capped priced servicing plan for it, so you know what!?\n\nBTW, my wife drives a Toyota!  Oh what a feeling, Toyota!\n\nOh, i don't get that feeling with LDV!  In fact, it is the opposite!\n\nCome on LDV!  Pull your socks up!  A sparky like me gave you guys a break (try), please as least give it your best shot!\n\nBTW, because of this sour experience with LDV, i am never going to buy another LDV ever again \u0026 i have been telling everybody who wants to know what i think of my 2017 LDV G10, that it is not worth the pain \u0026 the stress \u0026 the headache \u0026 your marriage over a van!\n\nGame over LDV!?\n\nI feel sorry for all the people that works in LDV.  Especially in LDV Parramatta Service Centre.  To come to work everyday to hear more customer complaints on their LDVs, every single work day.\n\nSo, i have made it my mission to whenever someone asked me about my 2017 LDV G10, i will give them a thumbs down!\n\nP.s. My reverse camera works when it feels like it!?  And the funny thing is, the senior service technician came to me in person \u0026 told me he personally fixed it, when it was within its manufacturer warranty, means there is more to the poor LDV product than the technician himself.\n\nP.s.s. I don't know if i should laugh it off or cry!?","Images":null,"When":""},{"Name":"Gourav Chawla","ProfilePicture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLehqnzklTTEhvZYBS_zo1tRKpYkQHepAURenPquBYjVTK-8g=s120-c-rp-mo-br100","Rating":1,"Description":"Don‚Äôt get the service here.

Constantly saying \"I don't know\" just pleading negligence as if this isn't his job and wouldn't know about any of this\"\nHis manager luckily refunded my $1000 deposit before i had to take it further.\nThe Hilux was a total rust bucket, and when i first rocked up before even seeing the car, Jimmy asked if i wanted to hand over the cash now, or test drive it first.\nBuyer beware. As dodgy as they come.\nKeep in mind, this guy had the audacity to say i was in the wrong for not getting an independent inspection after misleading me like this, are you guys not a car dealership?\nThis car was literally built in 2016, they've bought it at a rock bottom price in hopes they can flick it off to someone gullible.\nIf you see this Hilux 2016 4x4 auto, be very careful, as it has been relisted on carsales.\nI would avoid this dealership at all cost.\nAnd i'm sure they will make some sort of effort to have this review removed - a typical tactic of dodgy buisness owners.\nBy the way, they've resprayed the tray i'd assume the day before i arrived, could still smell it and was still a little bit sticky when lifting latches.\nThe clay was half way up the side of the radiator and halfway up the chassy consistently all throughout.\nIf you are going to try scam someone, at least half know what you are doing. I could easily pick bits of flaky rust off with my hand on multiple parts of the car.\nAbsolute joke, you should be reported to consumer affairs.\nIf anyone wants the photos of what he sent me vs the photos i took, message me privately.\n**They keep having my honest review taken down by google somehow**","Images":["www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIHM0ogKEICAgICz6aT42gE\u0026fid=0x0:0xbdc26d7378baaddb"],"When":"2024-6-3"},{"Name":"chantelle mccristal","ProfilePicture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJWmbGbJjlXSmdpGLcKvozh4OxMKLROJg98_B5FTAtqcezS7w=s120-c-rp-mo-br100","Rating":5,"Description":"We are very happy with the help we received from Con and Ralph from start to finish!

I am writing to express my utmost dissatisfaction with my recent experience purchasing an LDV Bus from your dealership and the subsequent handling of issues that arose shortly after the purchase.\n\nOn 23/06/2023, I purchased a brand new LDV Bus from your dealership. To my dismay, within one week of the purchase, the vehicle experienced a severe breakdown, rendering it inoperable. I immediately contacted your workshop and notified them of the issue, hoping for a swift resolution. However, the experience that followed has been nothing short of a nightmare.\n\nThe vehicle was taken to your workshop for repairs, but instead of resolving the issue, it appears that the vehicle suffered additional damage during the repair process. This is completely unacceptable and has caused significant inconvenience and financial burden to me. I expected a brand new vehicle to be reliable, and the current situation has shattered my confidence in the product and your after-sales service.\n\nTo make matters worse, your workshop seems unwilling to take responsibility for the damages caused and has suggested that I should take the vehicle back without it being adequately fixed. This is simply unacceptable, as I refuse to accept a faulty vehicle that can potentially cause more harm down the road. Moreover, I was informed that I would be charged for not taking the vehicle back, which is not only unfair but adds insult to injury.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, the communication and response from your workshop and dealership have been extremely slow, leaving me in the dark about the status of my vehicle and the progress of the resolution process. This lack of responsiveness and accountability has only added to my frustration and disappointment.\n\nI expect immediate action to be taken to rectify the situation. I demand that my LDV Bus be thoroughly inspected, repaired to an excellent working condition, and compensated for any additional damages caused during the repair process. Furthermore, I request a written assurance that such issues will not arise in the future and a clear explanation of how you plan to prevent such incidents.\n\nI trust that you understand the gravity of this situation and will take the necessary steps to address my concerns promptly. I urge you to treat this matter with the utmost urgency to avoid further escalation.\n\nIf my concerns are not adequately addressed within a reasonable timeframe, I may have no choice but to seek legal assistance and share my negative experience with others, including on social media platforms and relevant consumer review websites.","Images":null,"When":""},{"Name":"Jamie Rogers","ProfilePicture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKt3y4EIpMDjfV9SEx337Neb55ie9Uebx7Wtcq3hxANa5kw-g=s120-c-rp-mo-br100","Rating":5,"Description":"Great people, friendly, made the whole process easy, I have bought a new car from Toyota in the past and the team at LDV Kingswood left them in the dust.

Everything looked amazing at face value and it was a huge upgrade from the car I had at the time. Despite my strong distrust for car dealerships, I had a good feeling and decided to take the leap. The dealer wouldn't allow my brother (a mechanic) to scan the car for any potential problems until a deposit was made. He also promised 3 months warranty if any problems did arise after purchase. With warranty as a safety net, I bought the car and was in love- until oil started leaking from the rocket gasket and the SRS light appeared on my dash.\n\n\"No problem\", I thought. It has warranty. I took the car in and the men were more than happy to help. I drove away and mere days later, the car was leaking oil again and the SRS light had returned. So, I emailed the dealership and was met with a pathetic \"your car is older than 10 years old, so the warranty is void. We repaired your car out of good will.\" Of course, after threatening to involve fair trading, LDV invited me to bring my car in for ANOTHER inspection and repair. This time they actually did their job- or so I thought.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my car was leaking puddles of oil. I rang my mechanic brother who urged me to go to the nearest mechanic I could find. The mechanic was astounded by what he saw. He regrettably informed me that whoever had done my last major service (of course, it was LDV) had screwed the cap too tightly on the oil filter, to the point where it had pierced the filter and it had now cracked, leaking large quantities of oil everywhere. If I had driven for 10 more minutes, he said my engine would have ran out of oil and imploded. Along with this, my rocket gasket cover had never been replaced, as LDV had ensured me. Instead, it had been temporarily sealed with silicone. How convenient that it was a temporary fix that would last just long enough that the promised 3 month warranty  would be voided by the time it became a problem. And, of course, bad things come in threes. That same day, I found out that LDV had never supplied me with a wheel lock key. The mechanic found this out as he was unable to remove my wheel to access my rocket gasket cover without it. I can't even say I was surprised with anything this mechanic was telling me.\n\nCar dealerships have a horrible reputation for a reason. I will personally never trust any dealership again and I was stupid enough to do so in the first place. LDV sold a car that was a huge safety risk and tried to trick me out of repairing it by blaming the age of the car rather than their incompetence. As promised, fair trading will definitely be getting involved.","Images":null,"When":""},{"Name":"Steve Petrevski","ProfilePicture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLKDSOgOW3JCKaD5KtGYIkSNK3CyIt1ACXZMwv_Zz_O9n2dbQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100","Rating":5,"Description":"Thanks Con and the team at LDV Carwise.

I bought the LDV D90 last year because it had great features and was spacious. But before my first service, a part on the back side came out. During the first service, I mentioned the issue to the service provider, and they said they would organize the car part for me. I was expecting a call, but they never got back to me. After a few months, I called and asked about the part, and they said they had received it. Such bad service!\n\nYesterday, when I booked my car to get the part fixed, they told me I had to keep my car there for the whole day. They had initially said it would only take an hour. I couldn't stay the whole day because I had no other way to get home. At the service center, a person named Kris said they would call and book my car for the part fix. But yesterday passed, and I haven't received any call or message from the service center.\n\nI don't think I should recommend LDV to anyone else. If the service center treats existing customers like this, I wonder how they would serve new customers.
